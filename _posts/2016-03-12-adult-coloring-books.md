Look at my new project!

I'm working on my sequel to "Profanity" my adult coloring book. I listened to the feedback on Amazon and I'm making big improvements to this edition. It's WAY more pages, sayings, better doodles to color, and lots of the word f\*ck.

Follow me on Instagram to see my sketches. Want to send me a request? Tag me in the comments on one of my posts.

So excited for this one!
